## Overview ##

This program is designed to create offline archives of various Learning Management Systems (LMS). It is created as a part of the [Rensselaer Center for Open Source](https://rcos.io/projects/lmsgrabber/lmsgrabber/profile) and [Software Design and Documentation](https://sites.google.com/site/rpisdd/) courses.

Currently being worked on by [Jacob Lane](https://github.com/Jacob-Lane), [Colin Atkinson](https://github.com/colatkinson), [Daniel Zhu](https://github.com/zhuguotian), [Chris Vecchio](https://github.com/ChrisVech), [Mark Robinson](https://github.com/robinm8), and [Adeet Phanse](https://github.com/phansa).

Inspired by the [Original Python version](https://github.com/slegec/LMS_Grabber) by [Craig Slegel](https://github.com/slegec).
